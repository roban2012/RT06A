 Burma’s Thein Sein Visits Washington<br><br>

Ignoring human-rights protests, the Obama Administration is looking at long-term investment in Burma, er, Myanmar<br><br>

By Jay Newton-Small May 20, 2013
<br><br>
 Burmese President Thein Sein arrives at the White House for a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama on May 20, 2013 <br><br>


Barack Obama hasn’t had a lot of good news of late on the foreign policy front. His nonplan for Syria is under fire from all sides. His nonstrategy for the Arab Spring ― from Benghazi and Cairo to Iran and Bahrain ― has drawn near daily criticism. Chinese hacking is getting worse. The war in Afghanistan drones on. And so it must have been with some sense of relief that the President turned his attention Monday to the one small foreign policy victory his first term can claim: normalization of relations with Burma.<br><br>

Obama welcomed Burmese general turned President Thein Sein to the White House, the first Burmese leader to visit in nearly 47 years. Despite outrage from human-rights activists ― dozens of whom protested at the White House gates on Pennsylvania Avenue ― the meeting was hailed as a landmark one. It follows Obama’s November trip to Rangoon, where he was the first sitting U.S. President to visit Burma. In honor of Thein Sein’s visit, the White House put out a statement calling Burma for the first time “Myanmar,” the preferred name of the military junta. Thein Sein updated Obama on his progress in making the political and economic reforms the two discussed in November and asked for further U.S. support in capacity building, reforming the rule of law, increased trade and military-to-military training, according to Ernie Bower, a Burma expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who met with Thein Sein in Washington on Sunday. “This visit is overwhelmingly important. American engagement in Myanmar is one of the more significant geostrategic developments in our overall Asia strategy in last couple of years,” Bower says.<br><br>

The reopening of Burma to the Western world is a blow to Chinese influence in Southeast Asia. For much of the past 20 years China was one of the big investors in Burma. But decades of what local authorities came to view as abuse by Chinese companies exploiting Burma’s bountiful natural resources helped create an opening for the Obama Administration, says Ken Lieberthal, a China expert at the Brookings Institution. Chinese leaders are “increasingly concerned with the resentment they’re experiencing in Burma. They’re trying to engage on a modified model ― building schools, trying to come across as a good neighbor ― and that requires a lot of repositioning and that will take time,” Lieberthal says. “They’re always concerned when the U.S. presence and influence grows around their periphery, and that is happening in a major way in Burma.”<br><br>

It also comes at a time when Chinese relations with other Southeast Asia countries are fraying. Border disputes with the Philippines and Vietnam have soured relations with those two countries. Several signatories to a 2010 Chinese free-trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are seeking to renegotiate it as they feel the deal gives too much away to China. And China’s then Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi didn’t help matters much when he declared at an ASEAN meeting last October, “There is one basic difference among us. China is a big state and you are smaller states.”<br><br>

The Obama Administration has done a good job of courting Burma, both Lieberthal and Bower say, at a time when Burma’s influence with the ASEAN countries ― and with its neighbor to the west, India ― is on the rise. The U.S. strategy in “repositioning” Washington’s attention to Asia has been to use the existing multinational institutions like ASEAN, APEC, the East Asian Summit, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (though the U.S. is still just looking at becoming a member to this one) to influence China, Bower says. “We’ve been using these frameworks to convince China to make the rules with their neighbors in this region and play by these rules,” he says. Burma is a key member of almost all these groups, Bower adds, and while the U.S. and Burma were at odds, America’s ability to sway regional decisions was limited.<br><br>

Of course, none of this would’ve been possible without the blessing of Nobel Peace Prize laureate and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who visited Washington last September to much fanfare. Suu Kyi, who spent the better part of two decades under house arrest for her political opposition to the junta, has been working with Thein Sein to open up Burma. On her visit, she called on Washington to lift its sanctions on Burma and even encouraged U.S. officials to call her country Myanmar. Notably, as Thein Sein was in Washington, a 12-member delegation from Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy was on the first of two planned visits this year to China at Beijing’s invitation.<br><br>

Will anything truly substantive come out of Monday’s meeting? Perhaps some marginal progress on a few fronts, says Bowers. “Obama may not be able to do some of the more forward-leaning requests, like adding Burma to the Generalized System of Preferences,” which gives preferential duty-free entry into the U.S. market for up to 5,000 products for developing countries that qualify. “But it’s clear the Administration is committed to working with [Thein] Sein, and underlining that is important in itself.” Because despite the outraged protesters at the White House gates, the Obama Administration believes it can achieve a lot more working with the not-quite-democracy than against it ― not just for Burma but also for Asia.<br><br>
 June 4, 2013, Chinese Investment in Myanmar Falls Sharply <br><br>
 By JACOB GRONHOLT-PEDERSEN <br><br>
Chinese investment in Myanmar has fallen sharply over the past year amid strained relations, even as interest from other foreign investors in the Southeast Asian has surged.<br><br>

The drop comes as China is wrapping up construction of its last large-scale investment project in Myanmar: the construction of two pipelines that this year will transport oil and natural gas from the Bay of Bengal through Myanmar into southern China.<br><br>

China was Myanmar's closest political and trading partner for several decades before 2011, when Myanmar―hit by sanctions from the West because of Myanmar's authoritarian policies―began a series of political and economic overhauls.<br><br>

Now, as Myanmar increasingly looks to the West, popular sentiment has been turning against China and its historically close ties with the former military junta. Influential Myanmar human-rights group 88 Generation last month called for China to renegotiate its investment contracts. The group said the contracts were made in opaque deals with the former Myanmar regime.<br><br>

The objections―along with protests against Chinese projects, often for environmental reasons―are signs of growing concern in Myanmar over its neighbor's rising economic, military and political influence.<br><br>

In the most significant recent blow to relations between the two countries, Myanmar President Thein Sein stopped a Chinese-backed $3.7 billion hydropower dam project in 2011 in response to local opposition. The project would have supplied electricity to China.<br><br>

Protests in November led to the temporary suspension of a Chinese-backed copper-mine project. Talks on a multibillion-dollar railway linking Myanmar's west coast with Kunming in southern China also have been put on hold.
<br><br>
Last week, state-run China Mobile Ltd. 0941.HK +2.73%said it had pulled out of bidding for telecommunications licenses in Myanmar in a consortium with the U.K.'s Vodafone Group VOD.LN -1.07%PLC, saying the opportunity didn't "meet the internal investment criteria."<br><br>

Myanmar reported that Chinese companies invested $407 million in the country in the fiscal year through March 31, down from $4.35 billion and $8.27 billion in the previous two years, respectively. Chinese investors accounted for 29% of Myanmar's total foreign investment during the period.<br><br>

The anti-Chinese protests and escalating violence between ethnic separatist rebels and government troops in northeastern Myanmar near the Chinese border have become a concern for Beijing, said Zhao Hong, a Chinese professor who is a visiting research fellow at the National University of Singapore.
<br><br>
Two Myanmar nationals working as subcontractors for China National Petroleum Corp. on the oil and gas pipelines were killed last month after rebels opened fire at a compound near the Chinese border.<br><br>

"The Chinese government has warned its companies to be more cautious about investing in Myanmar. They have become more unsure about the future of the country," Mr. Hong said. Uncertainty over the political reforms and the tensions have had a chilling effect on Chinese investment in Myanmar, he said. "Only state-owned companies dare to go, and even they won't put money into big projects now."<br><br>

The drop in Chinese investment caused total foreign investment in Myanmar to fall to $1.42 billion in past fiscal year from $4.64 billion and $20 billion in the two previous years, according to the government.<br><br>

Most of the overall foreign investment in the country in the past year was in manufacturing, power generation, oil and gas projects, and the hotel-and-tourism sector.<br><br>

Still, China remains Myanmar's largest trading partner. Myanmar imported $175 million of Chinese goods in March―mainly machinery, base metals and transportation equipment―making up nearly a third of total imports for the month.<br><br>

China's Envoy Tacks With Winds Of Change In Myanmar (Burma)<br><br>

Chinese envoys to Myanmar (Burma) used to have it easy. The military junta that handed over power in April 2011 counted on Beijing for political support and reciprocated with over $20 billion worth of investment opportunities in Myanmar’s rich natural resources. While Western powers shunned the regime for its right abuses and imposed economic sanctions, Chinese envoys enjoyed unparalleled access to the top brass. Now that the winds of change have blown and the junta is no more, replaced by a civilian administration eager to court the West, China faces a far trickier task in managing relations with Myanmar. Its valuable investments in gas pipelines and hydropower dams have become a lightning rod for critics emboldened by parliamentary democracy and an end to press censorship.<br><br>

Beijing’s new man in Myanmar is Yang Houlan, whose previous postings include ambassadorships in Kabul and Kathmandu. Yang arrived in March and has met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, and civil society activists as well as government officials. He says that his job is to improve relations with all sides in Myanmar and correct “misunderstandings” about China’s economic interests. “Myanmar is into a transitional period. There’s a new situation we have to face,” he says. Speaking in English during an hour-long interview on May 23, he conceded that Chinese state-owned enterprises shared some blame for the negative views of China held in Myanmar. One reason, he says, is that Chinese SOEs have failed to promote their social outreach activities. ”In the past, China has the practice of doing, not speaking. People don’t know how these projects will (help) national development and people’s interests. That’s the problem,” Yang told FORBES.<br><br>


Earlier this month, Yang visited the starting point in western Myanmar for cross-country oil and gas pipelines built by China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC). An oil depot will transfer crude destined for southwest China’s energy-hungry cities. Offshore gas tapped by Daewoo International will follow the same route. The gas pipeline is due for completion by Jun 1, though it’s unclear when supplies would start flowing. CNPC has said that it’s spending over $20 million on communities living in the project area and along the pipeline’s route, which passes through ethnic minority areas. As The New York Times noted, this brings CNPC in line with Western multinationals that typically carry out, and publicize, social responsibility projects in developing markets. Yang says the embassy has encouraged firms to go public. “We have asked Chinese companies to change their practice and have more communication with locals,” he says.<br><br>

However, such advice comes too late for China Power Investment, the Chinese firm building a giant hydropower dam along the Irrawaddy River in northern Kachin state. In 2011, President Thein Sein announced the suspension of Myitsone dam, citing “the people’s will”. Chinese officials were caught off guard by the decision, which was widely seen as a pushback by the new administration against a Chinese resource grab. Yang claims that there are “misunderstandings” over the project, but seems resigned to a long wait for resolution. “It was a decision by the president. This government will not restart the project,” he says. Other smaller dams along the same river network are still underway, despite intermittent fighting between government troops and Kachin rebels.<br><br>

To China’s discomfort, Myitsone became a national symbol in 2011 of unbridled foreign extraction of resources. Compounding the anger over its environmental impact and the displacement of thousands of villagers is the fact that most of the electricity generated was to be exported via transmission lines to southwest China. Given the remote location of the dam, and the underwhelming state of the local economy, such a deal makes some sense, provided the proceeds are reinvested wisely. However, the revival of Myanmar’s economy under new management changes this equation as domestic energy shortages are acute. It might prove palatable to rethink the project along these lines. But the damage to China’s image is already done. Meanwhile, Thailand is currently the biggest beneficiary of Myanmar’s energy resources: over 25% of its electricity is generated from gas piped over the border.<br><br>

Yang says China views Myanmar’s social and economic development as a “win-win” for both countries. But as ambassador he recognizes that this message doesn’t always come across in Myanmar. So the Chinese embassy is using Facebook FB   (banned in China) and public forums to get its message out and counter negative opinions in Myanmar’s punchy press, which is making up for years of suppression at the hands of the military. Yang says that the media often relies on rumours, not facts to make judgements on China’s investments in resource industries. “Some media look through colored glasses at Chinese projects,” he says.<br><br>

Take CNPC’s school building program. The company says it has built several schools, as well as clinics and other facilities, along the pipeline’s route, part of its $20 million largesse (the biggest chunk is set aside for power generation). But protesters have taken issue with the program, saying that the new schools lack teachers. Yang is frustrated by such criticism. ”This isn’t the Chinese company’s responsibility. We can’t provide teachers. This is the government’s responsibility,” he says. Welcome to the pitfalls of corporate social responsibility in developing countries with rich resources and feeble government.<br><br>

Myanmar's Ethnic Conflict Flares In Shadow Of Asian Oil Investments<br><br>

In a setback for reformers, ethnic violence has spread in western Myanmar (Burma), killing scores of civilians and displacing over 32,000 people. Following the latest fighting between Rakhine and Rohingya groups, satellite images released by Human Rights Watch appear to show the wholesale destruction last week of a coastal community of Rohingya. Boatloads of evacuees have since arrived in camps opened after previous deadly clashes elsewhere in June. Muslim Rohingya face widespread discrimination in a majority Buddhist country that doesn’t recognise them as citizens. Even Rohingya that have lived for generations in Myanmar are accused of being illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. The U.N. estimates the Rohingya population in Myanmar at 800,000 people. This excludes tens of thousands displaced to Bangladesh and others who have sought refugee protection in Southeast Asia. The head of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a grouping that includes Myanmar, has warned that the Rohingya crisis could destabilise the region.<br><br>

While the renewed fighting is troubling for a fragile, multi-ethnic country that has just begun to open up after decades of isolation, the unrest spells particular risk for Asian energy firms. The burnt-out Rohingya community seen in the satellite photo was located in Kyaukpyu in the Bay of Bengal. This is an operational hub for multi-billion dollar investments by Daewoo International, which has offshore gas concessions, and China National Petroleum Co., which is constructing two cross-country pipelines to southwest China. The first, a gas pipeline, may begin operating as early as April 2013 with 400m cubic feet a day supplied to China’s power sector. The second pipeline is designed to carry crude oil cargoes that dock in Kyaukpyu. CNPC has begun building a transshipment port and the twin pipelines, while Daewoo handles the gas production. Australian producer Woodside recently agreed to partner with Daewoo in further exploration in the Bay of Bengal. As Western sanctions against Myanmar are dismantled, more oil giants are likely to join the rush to tap these offshore resources.<br><br>
An international campaign group, the Shwe Gas Movement, has been putting pressure on Myanmar and its investors to compensate those displaced by pipeline, gas terminal and port. Much of the attention has been on the pipeline’s diagonal path across Myanmar and the role of the military in securing it. But there are also concerns about the impact on Kyaukpyu and other coastal areas. This map shows the project sites. It’s not clear exactly where the attacks on the Rohingya took place; HRW identifies the torched community as being on the eastern shore, near to the industrial zones where CPNC and Daewoo are invested. But the violence spread through several built-up areas in and around the town. An industry consultant in Myanmar told me that while the Chinese port was on the outskirts of Kyaukpyu, Daewoo is running its gas pipeline through a base in the town. This could become a more risky proposition if ethnic violence continues. It also raises security and human-rights concerns for other investors sizing up Myanmar’s oil and gas sector.<br><br>

BurmaCChina relations
<br><br>
Burma was the first non-Communist country to recognize the Communist-led People's Republic of China after its foundation in 1949.[1] Burma and the People's Republic of China formally established diplomatic relations on June 8, 1950. China and Burma signed a treaty of friendship and mutual non-aggression and promulgated a Joint Declaration on June 29, 1954, officially basing their relations on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.[1][2] However, Burma maintained a neutralist foreign policy in the 1950s and 1960s. Anti-Chinese riots in 1967 and the expulsion of Chinese communities from Burma generated hostility in both countries.[2] Relations began to improve significantly in the 1970s. Under the rule of Deng Xiaoping, China reduced support for the CPB and on August 5, 1988 China signed a major trade agreement, legalizing cross-border trading and began supplying considerably military aid. Following the violent repression of pro-democracy protests in 1988, the newly formed State Peace and Development Council, facing growing international condemnation and pressure, sought to cultivate a strong relationship with China to bolster itself; in turn, China's influence grew rapidly after the international community abandoned Burma.<br><br>

Bilateral trade between China and Burma exceeds $1.4 billion.[4] Chinese imports to Myanmar typically focus around oil, steel and textile products, while Myanmar imports range from natural rubber to raw wood.[4] China is providing extensive aid and helping to develop industries and infrastructure in Burma and aims to be the chief beneficiary from cultivating Burma's extensive oil and natural gas reserves.[5] It is one of the chief partners of the Burmese regime in the project to renovate and expand the Sittwe seaport and has received rights to develop and exploit natural gas reserves in the Arakan region.[2] China has offered loans and credit to the military regime, as well as economic aid and investments for the construction of dams, bridges, roads and ports as well as for industrial projects.[1][2] China extensively aided the construction of strategic roads along the Irrawaddy River trade route linking Yunnan province to the Bay of Bengal. Chinese firms have been involved in the construction of oil and gas pipelines stretching 2,380 km (1,480 mi) from Burma's Arakan coast to China's Yunnan Province.[5] China National Offshore Oil Corporation and the China National Petroleum Corporation hold important contracts on upgrading Burmese oilfields and refineries and sharing of production.[2] PetroChina is in process of building a major gas pipeline from the A-1 Shwe oil field off the coast of the Rakhine State leading to Yunnan, accessing and exploiting an estimated 2.88 to 3.56 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.[2][6] A proposed Sino-Burmese oil pipeline off the western coast of Burma may permit China to import oil from the Middle East, bypassing the Strait of Malacca.[2][5] There have been protest against Chinese oil projects.[7]
<br><br>
China Power Investment Corporation's investment in the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydropower station on the Irrawaddy River has hit a snagged in early October 2011 as Burmese government suspended construction due to local residents' concern about the human, environmental impact and perceived benefits.[8][9] Most of the power generated will be exported to Yunnan province in China and local residents claimed the lack of community feedback in the planning process.[9] China's government is stating Burma will get 54 billions dollar in tax revenue, shared profits, free electricity.[9] At stake is China's huge financial stake in the project and also risk to other big projects China has in the country.[9] China Power Investment Corporation stated only five villages with a total of 2,146 needed to relocated. The firm has provided affected villagers with two storey houses, 21 in televisions and a 100,000 Burmese kyat compensation.[9]<br><br>


China is the most important supplier of military aid and maintains extensive strategic and military cooperation.[1] Since 1989, China has supplied Burma with jet fighters, armored vehicles and naval vessels and has trained Burmese army, air force and naval personnel.[1][2] Access to Burma's ports and naval installations provide China with strategic influence in the Bay of Bengal, in the wider Indian Ocean region and in Southeast Asia.[1][2][6] China has developed a deep-water port on Kyaukpyu in the Bay of Bengal.[6] It has also built an 85-metre jetty, naval facilities and major reconnaissance and electronic intelligence systems on the Great Coco Island,[2][10] located 18 kilometres from India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, giving China capabilities to monitor India's military activities, including missile tests.[2] China assists in constructing a naval base in Sittwe, a strategically important sea port close to eastern India's largest city and port, Kolkata.[10] Beijing also funds road construction linking Yangon and Sittwe, providing the shortest route to the Indian Ocean from southern China.
<br><br>
China and Russia once vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution designed to punish Burma.[5][11] In recent years, China has shown a lack of willingness to back the Burmese government and has attempted to stabilize the political situation in Burma.[5]<br><br>

In recent years, Burma has moved to develop strategic and commercial relations with India, with which it shares a long land border and the Bay of Bengal. Increasing trade and military cooperation with India and developing bilateral relations with Japan and within the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) shows a shift in Burma's foreign policy to avoid excessive dependence on China.[1]<br><br>

After the Kokang incident in August 2009 which gained international media interest, some experts questioned its impact on BurmaCChina relations, which were considered to be strong.[12] Bertil Lintner stated that Burma was prioritizing internal conflicts over its ties with China,[13] however some Chinese analysts, such as Shi Yinhong, played down the relationship between Burma and China, saying "They're not great friends. They don't listen to what China says."[13] China had urged Burma to ensure the stability of the border area and protect the interests of its citizens in Burma.[14][15] The Burmese Foreign Ministry later apologised to China about the incident, but also ran a story on the Dalai Lama in the government newspaper the Myanmar Times, the first mention of him in the state controlled Burmese media for 20 years.[16] Chinese officials were said to be "furious" and "extremely upset" over not being forewarned about the offensive on the border.[16]

Chinese dilemma over Burma protests 
 <br><br>
  


 By Michael Bristow  <br><br>
 BBC News, Beijing  <br><br>
  25 September 2007 
<br><br>

  China, which has become one of Burma's main supporters over recent years, has remained largely silent about the current protests. <br><br>
Beijing is traditionally reluctant to speak publicly about the internal affairs of other countries. <br><br>

But, despite this, there are signs that Chinese politicians are anxious to help stabilise the political situation in Burma. <br><br>

They perhaps do not want to tarnish China's image ahead of next year's Beijing Olympics by appearing to support any military crackdown in Burma. <br><br>

Officially, China is playing down its ability to influence events in Burma. <br><br>

"China always adopts a policy of non-interference," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu at a regular press briefing. <br><br>

 

 

 It is in China's long-term business interests to make sure its neighbour is stable <br><br>

 
 
"As Myanmar's (Burma's) neighbour, China hopes to see stability and economic development in Myanmar," she added. <br><br>

"The stability of Myanmar serves the interest of Myanmar itself and the interests of the international community." <br><br>

But China's ties with the military junta ruling Burma go deep, and include expanding trade links, the sale of military hardware and diplomatic support. 
<br><br>
Energy corridor <br><br>

"In the last decade or two, with the improving economic situation in China and the increasing isolation of Burma, China has become increasingly important to the regime," said a spokesman for the Asian Human Rights Commission, based in Hong Kong. <br><br>

The relationship between Burma and China is mainly based on trade. Burma, which has very little industry itself, imports manufactured goods from China. <br><br>

"If you walk around the streets in Burma, particularly in the north, the overwhelming majority of manufactured goods are Chinese made," said the commission spokesman, who regularly visits Burma. <br><br>

That trade is reflected in official Chinese figures, which show that exports from China to Burma were up by 50% in the first seven months of this year. They were worth $964m . <br><br>

 


 Beijing does not want to be associated with any crackdown<br><br>
 
 
Burma mainly exports raw materials, such as timber and gems, to China. <br><br>

According to research published a few days ago by EarthRights International, 26 Chinese multinational firms were involved in 62 major projects in Burma over the last decade. <br><br>

These include the construction of oil and gas pipelines stretching 2,380km (1,479 miles) from Burma's Arakan coast to China's Yunnan Province. <br><br>

The rights group, based in the United States and South East Asia, says this is to help China import oil and gas from the Middle East, Africa and South America. <br><br>

Official Chinese figures say total imports from Burma amounted to just $146m in the first seven months of this year. 
<br><br>
But others doubt the accuracy of these figures. Rights group Global Witness estimated timber exports to China alone were worth $350m in 2005 - most of it illegally exported. <br><br>

China also sells Burma military hardware, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission. <br><br>

And Beijing used its veto in the United Nations' Security Council in January to block criticism of Burma's military junta. <br><br>

'Restore stability' <br><br>

But despite these deep links, China has shown signs of promoting reform in Burma over recent months. <br><br>

 


 
 
In June this year it hosted low-profile talks in Beijing between representatives from the US and Burma. <br><br>

And earlier this month, senior Chinese diplomat Tang Jiaxuan had some advice for visiting Burmese Foreign Minister U Nyan Win. <br><br>

"China whole-heartedly hopes that Myanmar (Burma) will push forward a democracy process that is appropriate for the country," he said, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. <br><br>

Tang, who acts as a foreign policy adviser, said China "hoped Myanmar would restore internal stability as soon as possible, properly handle issues and actively promote national reconciliation".  <br><br>

China is perhaps wary of backing a regime that might order a violent crackdown of protesters ahead of next year's Beijing Olympics. <br><br>

Beijing is extremely sensitive to criticism about any of its foreign policies before the event is held. They do not want anything to spoil the games. <br><br>

Chinese officials have already tried to limit criticism of Beijing's support for Sudan by backing a UN plan that aims to bring peace to the African country's troubled Darfur region. <br><br>

And, as the Asian Human Rights Commission spokesman said, it is in China's long-term business interests to make sure its neighbour is stable.

Yangon still under Beijing's thumb<br><br>
By Sudha Ramachandran <br><br>

BANGALORE - While the sacking of Myanmar's prime minister Khin Nyunt in mid-October last year might have taken China by surprise, his exit from the power structure appears not to have weakened - as India had hoped - Beijing's influence in the country. China's influence in Myanmar seems well protected by the significant dependence of the military junta in Yangon on Chinese weapons and investment. <br><br>

Khin Nyunt was widely regarded as pro-China. His arrest and subsequent ouster for "corruption" was therefore seen in Delhi as the removal of a big obstacle in the path of India's growing quest for influence in Myanmar. India and China, Myanmar's two large neighbors, are competing for influence in the country. But unlike India's more recent wooing of Myanmar's generals, China's ties with them are well-entrenched. <br><br>

In fact, Myanmar's close relations with China go back several decades. And analysts have often drawn attention to the fact that Myanmar's ties with China are marked with several "firsts". Myanmar was the first country outside the communist bloc to recognize the People's Republic of China in 1949, the first to conclude a Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression with the nation, the first to achieve a boundary settlement in 1961, and one of the first to patch up relations with China after the Cultural Revolution which was officially declared over in 1977. <br><br>

Since 1988, when Myanmar's army seized power in a bloody coup, China has been the military junta's staunchest ally. The ruling junta is shunned by the West for its abysmal human-rights record and for its stubborn refusal to hand power to pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy won around 80% of the seats in the 1990 elections. China has been among the few countries that have refrained from criticizing the ruling generals for the bloody coup or for their utter contempt for democratic norms since then. <br><br>

Myanmar's generals see China's substantial economic, military and political support as vital, in a world where they have few powerful friends. China is officially Myanmar's third-largest trading partner after Singapore and Thailand - though the figure probably underestimates the substantial informal trade that takes place across their shared border. China has provided Myanmar with more than US$200 million in economic assistance. It has helped with the development of Myanmar's infrastructure - the construction of roads, railroads, airfields, ports and dams throughout the country. And China is believed to be the largest foreign investor in Myanmar, though the size of this investment is not recorded and not visible in international statistics. <br><br>

China is also Myanmar's most important defense ally, supplying most of its military hardware and training. Over the past decade, China's military sales to Yangon, which include jet fighters, armored vehicles and naval vessels, have been valued at around $2 billion. This has made the Myanmar military - the second largest in Southeast Asia after Vietnam - much more technically sophisticated. It has enabled the army to expand from 180,000 men to more than 450,000 today. <br><br>

Khin Nyunt is believed to have played a substantial role in expanding and deepening this relationship with China, and his departure from Myanmar's political scene was therefore seen as a setback to China's role in Myanmar. This perception was further strengthened by the junta's top leader, General Than Shwe, who is also the commander-in-chief of its defense forces, going ahead with his visit to India - the first by a Myanmarese head of state in 25 years - within a week of Khin Nyunt's ouster. <br><br>

A significant warming in the India-Myanmar relationship was visible during Than Shwe's visit, contributing to some jubilation in New Delhi that its decade-long efforts to woo the generals were slowly paying off. The exit of Khin Nyunt, especially in light of Than Shwe's visit to India, was viewed in Delhi as likely to result in a possible tilt in Myanmar's equations with its two giant neighbors in India's favor. Such hopes have, however, been dismissed by analysts such as Mohan Malik, professor at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, who warn that "expectations of a major strategic shift" in Yangon's foreign policy are "premature and unwarranted". <br><br>

Indeed, while Than Shwe indicated through his India visit that he was willing to romance Delhi, the military junta quickly took steps to reassure China of its friendship. Within days of Than Shwe's visit to India, the new prime minister, Lieutenant General Soe Win, visited China. Myanmar's Chief of General Staff General Thura Shwe Mann went to China soon after. During his visit, China and Myanmar signed a memorandum of understanding on the establishment of a border defense talks mechanism and the management of border affairs. <br><br>

These events indicate that notwithstanding Khin Nyunt's exit, Myanmar, on account of its substantial dependence on China's political, diplomatic, economic and military support, is unlikely to disturb its relationship with Beijing. While it might be keen to improve ties with India and has shown considerable sensitivity to India's concerns regarding anti-India insurgents taking sanctuary on Myanmar soil, this is not going to be at the cost of its ties with China. <br><br>

How Beijing benefits<br><br>
It is not just the junta that is keen on not shaking the Myanmar-China relationship. Beijing too is anxious to ensure that its influence in Myanmar is not eroded. Economic ties with Myanmar are viewed in Beijing as vital to the economic development of its own impoverished provinces in the southwest - Yunnan, Sichuan and Guizhou. More importantly, Beijing sees Myanmar as an important path through which it can expand its strategic influence into Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. <br><br>

Malik argues: "An objective and realistic assessment of China's strategic and economic needs and Burma's [Myanmar's] predicament shows that Beijing is unlikely to easily give up what it has already gained in and through Burma ... Beijing will use all means available to keep Burma under its thumb. Clearly, Beijing did not provide diplomatic protection, arms, aid and finance - all on very generous terms - to Rangoon [Yangon] in its hour of need for nothing." <br><br>

Two reasons why China will double its efforts to ensure its influence in Myanmar are India's growing role in Myanmar and also Myanmar's declining dependence on Beijing. Sources in India's Ministry of External Affairs maintain that while China is miles ahead of India in the race to woo the generals and is nowhere near dislodging China as the junta's staunchest ally, India's influence in Myanmar is growing. They admit that China is unlikely to sit back, while India slowly builds its ties with the generals. <br><br>

Besides, today Myanmar is not quite so friendless. At one time it had no other choice than to be completely dependent on China. Today, it has other options. It can look to India, Japan and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and has been diversifying its economic and defense partners. Moreover, it is said that members of the military junta, especially people such as Maung Aye, the second most powerful man in Myanmar, are keen to reduce the country's dependence on China.<br><br>

Another factor that has prompted the generals' growing wariness of China's influence in Myanmar is the serious influx of ethnic Chinese into the country. There are stretches of land in Myanmar that are completely peopled by Mandarin-speaking ethnic Chinese and more than a million Chinese are said to have moved into Myanmar over the past decade. This influx is believed to have changed the demographic makeup of the country's north. Myanmar people are said to be very unhappy with the influx of Chinese, a development that they blame on the junta's embrace of the Chinese government. <br><br>

This, added to the groundswell of discontent against the generals in Myanmar, is prompting the junta to rethink its excessive dependence on China and it's encouragement of Beijing's role in the country. An attempt to break out of China's control was visible from the late 1990s onwards. China responded by twisting the generals' arms. For instance, it insisted that Myanmar pay interest on loans that had originally been granted interest-free when the junta sought closer defense ties with other countries in the region. <br><br>

The exit of Khin Nyunt is sure to have unsettled China. And China is unlikely to take the development quietly. Neither is it likely to be comforted by mere assurances from the generals that the Sino-Myanmar relationship will remain unchanged under the new dispensation in Yangon. It will expect Myanmar to show its loyalty to Beijing by not moving too enthusiastically in India's direction. <br><br>

Sino-Myanmar Relations: Analysis and Prospects<br><br>

by Lixin Geng <br><br>

 

 

Both China and Myanmar (2) name each other "paukphaw". This is the Myanmar word for sibling or intimate. It is a reflection of the closeness of Sino-Myanmar relations that "paukphaw" is never used for any other country. The two have maintained substantive relations for centuries. Based on China’s pragmatic foreign policy, Beijing supports Yangon’s (Rangoon’s) current military regime through the full spectrum of political, strategic, and economic ties. When Chinese President Hu Jintao met with the Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), Than Shwe, in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, in April 2005, he reiterated the strength of the relationship: "Since ancient times, the people of two countries have conducted close exchanges as brothers. To build good-neighbourly friendship between China and Myanmar is a major part of China's foreign policy with neighbouring countries." (3)<br><br>

Beyond the official rhetoric, Myanmar remains cautious about its relationship with China. In reality, Sino-Myanmar relations have undergone a series of ups and downs, and China even in modern history has posed a threat to Myanmar’s security. This was evidenced at the end of 1949 by the incursion of defeated Chinese Nationalist (Kuomintang - KMT) troops into the northern Shan State of Myanmar from China’s Yunnan province, and in 1967 which saw confrontations between Burmese and resident overseas Chinese, including militant Maoist students. This caused the anti-Chinese riot movement in Yangon, resulting in the two countries’ relations slumping to an historic low. The Myanmar leadership has been extremely sensitive about the country’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and its strict neutrality during the Cold War meant it refrained from accepting military and economic aid from China. However, this changed when the current regime, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), later renamed the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), came to power by staging a military coup in 1988 following democratic elections. Under mounting international pressure on the military regime, Yangon had no choice but to accept close relations with China for their survival.<br><br>

It is argued here that the prospects of Sino-Myanmar relations are basically sound and could improve further in the long-term. Meanwhile, in the short-term, tensions could erupt causing uncertainty in the relationship. On the one hand, Myanmar’s internal instability is a key issue that influences the two countries’ ties. On the other, external pressure on Myanmar, particularly from the United States and other western countries, could influence the direction of Sino-Myanmar relations. However, Myanmar’s location on the tri-junction of South Asia, Southeast Asia and China is potentially important for China to achieve its strategic presence in the Indian Ocean and hence become a two-ocean power. Economically, too, Myanmar is important for China as a trading outlet to the Indian Ocean for its landlocked inland provinces of Yunnan and other south-western parts of China. Furthermore, Sino-Myanmar ties are strategically useful for China to contain the influence of India and other powers in Southeast Asia.<br><br>

 

Historical and Political Background
<br><br>
Sino-Myanmar relations were evident since the founding of the kingdom of Bagan (Pagan, ancient Myanmar) in AD 849, (4) which occurred during China’s cosmopolitan Tang Dynasty (AD 618 C 907). However, when China came under the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) of the Mongols, relations were no longer friendly. Mongol-ruled China invaded and fragmented Bagan in 1287; the Mongols ruled parts of the country until 1303. (5) The Burmese subsequently had intermittent tributary relations with Chinese empires in the long sweep of history, but this situation was destroyed by the impact of Western imperialism. The fall of the last Burmese king occurred in 1885. (6) China’s last dynasty, the Qing, ended in 1911. Burma had become a British colony that was to gain independence in 1948, while China became a republic but faced civil war until 1949. Both suffered from the invasion of Japanese forces during Japan’s own imperialist expansion.<br><br>

After the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, Sino-Myanmar relations were generally stable, except for the aforementioned anti-Chinese riots which occurred in the late 1960s. Formal relations were established on 8 June 1950. Four years later, China, Myanmar and India jointly proclaimed the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence that were subsequently adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement as the basis for international relations. The Five principles are: (1) mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, (2) non-aggression, (3) non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, (4) equality and mutual benefits, and (5) peaceful co-existence and peaceful settlement of disputes. These were contained in the Sino-Burmese Joint Declaration of the 29th of June 1954. <br><br>

The relationship from 1950 to the present can be divided into four phases: ambivalent peaceful coexistence, 1949-1961; temporary setbacks, 1962-1970; improved relations, 1971-1988; and closer ties, 1989-present. The last phase saw the most significant change in Myanmar’s China policy: one from ‘strategic neutrality’ to ‘strategic alignment’. This paper focuses on analysis of Sino-Myanmar relations in the post-coup era since 1988.<br><br>

In order to forecast future ties between Myanmar and China, it is necessary to first analyse China’s foreign policy objectives, in particular its strategic goals towards Myanmar. Then this article will analyse Myanmar’s response. This will be followed by the influence on Sino-Myanmar relations exerted by other actors: the United States and other Western countries, India and ASEAN. <br><br>

 

Myanmar in China’s strategic framework<br><br>

China’s strategic consideration in regard to Myanmar hinges on Beijing’s pragmatic foreign policy and Myanmar’s geographic position. It may be divided into three parts: politics and security; energy resources; and economic considerations.<br><br>

Since the introduction of China’s reforms in 1979, Beijing’s Myanmar policy has conformed to its general policy of ensuring a stable external environment with neighbouring states so that its domestic modernization and development can proceed unhindered. Hence Beijing’s support of Yangon’s military regime is essentially defensive in rationale. Economic cooperation and construction of infrastructure is seen as the only way to improve local people’s living standards and maintain stability in this region. Geo-economically, Myanmar is important for China as a "land bridge" to revive its ‘Southwest Silk Road’ from Yunnan Province to Myanmar and westward to Bangladesh, India and the Europe. The link up with Myanmar could help to develop the poor economies in the south-western part of inland China. Trade is expected to expand significantly with the realization of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) with a population of 500 million. Moreover, with the development of ‘Greater Mekong Subregion Program’(7), not only China, but also Myanmar and other countries in this region will benefit. Therefore, Myanmar is important to China to implement its western development strategy. Yunnan’s provincial capital of Kunming, in particular, will benefit economically by linking up with Myanmar for trade and investments. The link up between China’s south-western provinces and mainland Southeast Asian states can shorten the gap of economic disparities between China’s rich coastal and its poor south-western inland provinces. <br><br>

1. Political and security considerations<br><br>

From the perspective of security, China and Myanmar have enhanced their military cooperation and exchanges since 1988.(8) Myanmar’s location at China’s southwest holds strategic importance for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in terms its reach to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar-controlled islands, which are about 30 km north of Indian-controlled islands. By the year 2050, China is expected to achieve world-class blue water naval status,(9) and Myanmar would be crucial for China’s multi-directional access to both the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. By not passing through the Strait of Malacca to reach the Bay of Bengal, the PLAN would be able to shorten the distance by 3000 km, reducing the voyage by five to six days. China and Myanmar were reportedly interested in joint development of a deep-water port at Kyaukpyu on Ramree Islands in the Bay of Bengal.(10) In 2003, China assisted Myanmar in building an 85-metre jetty to naval facilities on Great Coco Island, which lies 18 kilometres from India’s Nicobar Island. China also established a modern reconnaissance and electronic intelligence system on the island. These, along with electronic surveillance facilities at the Alexandra Channel in the Andaman Sea, monitor India’s military movements C including missile testing - in the Indian Ocean.(11) Thus China’s strategic gains in cultivating relations with Myanmar have long-term security implications.<br><br>

Since 1988, Myanmar has moved closer militarily to China. In 1989, the first military delegation arrived in Beijing to negotiate the purchase of arms. It resulted in approximately US$1.4 billion in purchases.(12) Beside the supply of arms (inclusive of jet fighters, armoured vehicles, and naval vessels), China also agreed to train Myanmar’s air force and army personnel. The motivation for the purchase was to upgrade Myanmar’s military capability to suppress minority separatist insurgencies. In 1994, Myanmar brought about US$400 million worth of arms.(13) In October 1996, Army Chief, General Maung Aye’s visit to China resulted in future military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries. China agreed to train 300 Myanmar air force and naval officers and to provide additional places for them in Chinese Staff colleges. China also offered favourable terms for Myanmar’s arms purchases offering free loans and granting credit to the military regime, as well as economic aid and investments for the construction of Myanmar’s basic infrastructure, such as dams, bridges, roads and ports as well as for industrial projects. Noteworthy is the construction of strategic roads along the Irrawaddy River trade route linking Yunnan province to the Bay of Bengal.<br><br>

China’s intention to seek close strategic alignment and economic cooperation with Myanmar could be seen to form the visit to Yangon of a high-level delegation (about 100 members) led by Li Peng from 26 to 28 December 1994. Both Li Peng and his counterpart, General Than Shee, agreed to affirm and further strengthen the close relations between the two countries. The communiqué issued at the end of the visit stated that both leaders were encouraged by the comprehensive ‘strengthening of relations’ and would continue to cooperate ‘in the economic, agricultural, environmental, cultural, tourism, forestry, education and scientific fields, and in combating illicit drugs’.(14) Although Myanmar and China have close bilateral military ties, China has encouraged Myanmar to have military links with other countries: for example, defence supply relations with Pakistan and an arms trade with Russia.(15) China claims that most of the arms sold to Myanmar were for defensive purposes.<br><br>

2. Energy resources <br><br>

With the development of its economy, the demand for energy sources has greatly expanded in China. Understandably, Myanmar’s oil and gas reserves have drawn China’s attention. However, its presence in Myanmar’s oil and gas fields has only recently been observed. The China’s National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) signed six contracts on production sharing with the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) of the Ministry of Energy, from October 2004 to January 2005.(16) The China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (SINOPEC) and its subsidiary Dian Qiangui Petroleum Exploration also operate on the inland fields. Moreover, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and its subsidiary Chinnery Assets have been awarded contracts to upgrade the four old oilfields in central Myanmar.<br><br>

These companies have invested US$163 million, rather small compared to the US$2,635million total foreign investment in Myanmar’s oil and gas sector. However, it is only in recent years that Chinese companies have vigorously invested in Myanmar. Out of 26 Chinese foreign investments, 16 projects were made either in FY 2004 or 2005, occupying nearly 70% in terms of investment value. Most of those were invested in the energy and mining sector.(17)<br><br>

Another big project is PetroChina’s plan to build a gas pipeline from the A-1 block in the Shwe field off the coast of Rahine State to Yunnan Province.(18) The Shwe field is of unconfirmed size. Of these, A-1 block is estimated to be the largest, containing 2.88 trillion to 3.56 trillion cubic feet of gas. PetroChina signed a memorandum of understanding with the Myanmar Oil Corporation (MOGE) to buy gas from the block for 30 years starting from 2009. Moreover, some Chinese scholars have suggested building a Sino-Myanmar oil pipeline from the western coast of Myanmar to Kunming.(19) If this suggestion is granted by the central government, China could import oil from Middle East through this pipeline, avoiding the Strait of Malacca.<br><br>

Myanmar already exports natural gas via pipeline to Thailand and this trade volume reached US $1.5 billion in 2005, becoming the largest foreign income earner.(20) Myanmar will have another big source of foreign earnings from gas exports to China in the near future. Moreover, oil and gas exports offer the Myanmar government a diplomatic advantage over its neighbouring countries. Indeed, India also made great efforts to secure Myanmar’s gas from the same A-1 block.(21) India eventually reached an agreement with Myanmar to purchase the gas with more favourable conditions based on ‘take or pay’. This means India guarantees earnings every year to Myanmar even if it is not able to access the gas. It would appear that Myanmar has come out the winner in the Sino-India rivalry for energy.<br><br>

3. Economic considerations<br><br>

Myanmar has a long tradition of economic links with China dating as far as the 11th century during the Bagan dynasty. Today’s trade at the people-to-people level is mainly conducted at the upper Myanmar Shan and Kachin States and the border of Yunnan province. China’s Yunnan province, which has a population of 44 million, was historically a ‘Southwest Silk Road’ trade route, linking Myanmar with Southwest Asia. It has now emerged as a potential target for China’s long-term strategic ambition, transforming the whole region as part of a golden ‘Quadrangle’ trade zone involving Yunnan, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. Moreover the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement represents a huge bonus for Yunnan province, since it would potentially open up trade to the entire Southeast Asian area.<br><br>

China’s enterprises have been heavily involved in Myanmar’s industrial infrastructure and energy development. Provision of economic cooperation to Myanmar expanded around 1997 when the United States imposed economic sanctions that banned new foreign investment. Moreover, Senior General Than Shwe’s state visit to Beijing in January 2003 marked another epoch, when China offered Myanmar a preferential loan of US $200 million and a US $6.25 million grant. In July 2003, the United States imposed stricter sanctions, which included a ban on all Myanmar-made products. Thus China stepped into the vacuum that was created by Western sanctions and compensated for Myanmar’s need for trade and economic cooperation. China’s economic cooperation and businesses were directed to focus on infrastructure development.<br><br>

Among the many infrastructure projects financed and constructed by Chinese government and Chinese enterprises, emphasis was given electric power generation.(22) Myanmar has suffered severe electricity shortages since the end of 1990s and the government has initiated massive dam-building programs for hydropower generation. Chinese companies constructed six hydropower plants and one thermal power station in the period 1996 to 2005, accounting for one-third of the entire national capacity. Among them, the Paunglaung hydropower project demonstrates the financial, managerial and technical capability of Chinese companies in this field.(23) It was completed by the Yunnan Machinery Import and Export Corporation (YMIEC) in March 2005. Its installed capacity of power generation (280 MW) surpasses that of Baluchaung (168MW), which had long been the biggest power source constructed by Japanese companies with Japanese war reparations and economic cooperation after World War II. The Paunglaung dam project was the biggest undertaking of the YMIEC. Indeed, it was China’s largest hydropower plant exported to Southeast Asia and Yunnan’s largest foreign trade project in Myanmar. The project was estimated to cost US $160 million, financed by the Export-Import Bank of China. In 2006, there were 11 major hydropower projects underway, with total generating capacity of 1734 MW. Contracts were signed for seven projects and all of them were with Chinese enterprises. The largest project is the Yeywa hydropower plant with the capacity of 790 mw.(24) Yeywa will cost US $700 million. In August 2003, the China Exim Bank approved a US $200 million loan at preferential interest rates for the project. The China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) gained contracts to provide generators and other equipment for the project. In addition to low-priced machinery, equipment and services, long-term and low-interest loans and export credits offered by public financial institutions made it possible for Chinese enterprises to become major players in this field.<br><br>

Yunnan Province obviously seeks a direct access route through Myanmar to sea ports from which it can export products to South Asia, the Middle East and Europe.(25) Such an outlet would also reduce transport costs and time, and would avoid the Malacca Strait in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea. <br><br>

China is a positive rather than negative factor in ensuring stable Sino-Myanmar relations. Though China has remained a staunch ally since 1988, it is concerned about Myanmar’s long-term political and social stability because of a failing economy and lack of political legitimacy. China supports the idea of UN mediation to bring about political dialogue between the current military government and the National League for Democracy’s Secretary-General, Aung San Suu Kyi.<br><br>

 

Myanmar’s Responses<br><br>

1. Political and security response<br><br>

Myanmar historically has relied on a foreign policy of strict neutrality, coupled with low-key bilateral relations based on the afore-mentioned ‘Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence’. From the first government to the current regime, all the leaders of Myanmar have placed high value on an independent foreign policy and rejected attempts at foreign interference in internal affairs. This foreign policy is reflected in Myanmar’s relations with China. From Myanmar’s perspective, Myanmar’s leaders have always watched China with suspicion. They have been particularly concerned about Chinese intervention in support of the Burmese Communist Party (BCP), as well as the perceived threat from the China's huge population. <br><br>

Why was strategic cooperation between Myanmar and China possible in 1988? The main reason was the West’s diplomatic isolation and sanctions on Myanmar. The military coup and the killing of the students in 1988 received strong criticism and resulted in western economic sanctions. China saw a golden opportunity to fill the strategic vacuum in Myanmar’s economic difficulties. Due to isolation and necessity, Myanmar decided to move closer to China so as to seek both military and economic assistance. The regime’s need for external support for its survival led the arms deals with China. At the same time, the current regime is still sceptical about China’s ambitions, and retreated into neutrality at the beginning of 21st century. In order to minimize Myanmar’s military dependency on China, in August 2001, Myanmar decided to purchase 12 MIG-29 fighters from Russia at a comparative low cost of between US $130 to US$150 million. Myanmar also sent 300 military personnel to Moscow for training to fly the MIG’s and to acquire missile technology.(26) The strategic significance of this purchase is that Russia offers another potential alternative to Myanmar to balance China and India. There have also been reports of Myanmar renewing ties with North Korea.(27)<br><br>

The closer strategic and economic ties between Myanmar and China have presented a dilemma for Yangon. How can it keep its independence, strategic neutrality and at the same time maintain a good relationship with its neighbouring states, especially with China?<br><br>

2. Economic and trade responses<br><br>

Since 1988, economic relations between China and Myanmar have accelerated. China is now a major supplier of consumer goods, durables, machinery and equipment, and intermediate products. China also offers markets for Myanmar’s exports such as wood, agricultural produce, marine products, minerals, and recently oil and gas. Border trade provides a direct route connecting the centre of Upper Myanmar to Yunnan Province in China.<br><br>

China occupies an important position in Myanmar’s external trade.(28) Myanmar’s exports to China increased from US $133.7 million in 1988 to US $169.4 million in 2003; its imports from China expanded sevenfold, from US $136.2 million in 1998 to US $967.2 million in 2003. China is one of Myanmar’s trading partners in non-energy related goods, such as clothing, beans, fish and rice. Trade statistics for Myanmar are often inconsistent, but in 2004 Myanmar’s exports were estimated at $3.1 billion, and the country’s imports were around $3.5 billion.(29) However, official figures are underestimated due to the amount of illegal smuggling of timber, gems, narcotics, and other products to China, Thailand and Bangladesh.<br><br>

Legitimate trade between China and Myanmar started increasing dramatically in 1989. On the year 1988-1989, trade increased eightfold from US $9.5million to US $76 million.(30) In 1995, the total value of trade grew to US $767 million, and after a slight decline in 1998, total trade recovered in 2000 to US $621 million. In 2004, Myanmar and China started free trade activities under the Early Harvest Plan, which is an advanced program of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area.(31) The plan covers 596 items, including meat and dairy products as well as fruits and vegetables. Myanmar will remove the tariff on these items by 2009. In 2005, Myanmar’s trade with China reached US $1.21 billion, equivalent to 20% percent of Myanmar’s foreign trade volume. Both countries hope to reach a target of US $1.5 billion in bilateral trade in the future. Trade deals signed in July 2005 worth US $300 million should help the two countries achieve this goal. Myanmar has also opened six trade points along the countries’ shared border to further facilitate transactions. The success of these recent commitments was reflected in the first four months of 2006 when trade between China and Myanmar reached US $466 million.(32)<br><br>

Not only has China granted Myanmar favourable trade agreements, such as preferential tariffs, but it is also the largest foreign investor in Myanmar. It has provided loans, labour contracts, and emergency aid. For example, in 1998, when Myanmar was faced with a debt crisis, China provided it with a US $150 million loan. In 2004, China loaned Myanmar US $200 million. In June 2006, China publicly announced its intent to provide Myanmar with special low-interest loan of another US $200 million.(33)<br><br>

Since 1982, China also initiated project and labour cooperation contracts in Myanmar.(34) By the end of 1999, Chinese companies had signed 507 contracts worth US $1.4 billion.(35) The vast majority of these are devoted to engineering; however, labour contracts also comprise a large portion of the total. By October 2002, Chinese companies had contracted a further 293 projects for a total value of over US $2.1 billion. In September 2005, China signed a US $46 million contract to provide Myanmar with equipment and power cables for the construction of Myanmar’s biggest hydropower plant. This was the fifth contract signed between the two countries on this project alone.<br><br>

 

Other Factors <br><br>

1. The West and Japan<br><br>

Historically, the importance of Myanmar for the United States and Western countries after World War Two has been linked with the spread of Communism. Western interest in Myanmar declined after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1990. But the strengthening of Sino-Myanmar ties has influenced other countries in the Asia-Pacific since 1988. Japan, for example, is concerned about China’s increasing influence in Myanmar. This has led the Japanese government to restore its aid and grants despite opposition from the US and other Western countries.(36)<br><br>

Washington’s attitude towards Myanmar is well known throughout the world, and it drives economic and political pressure for a change in Yangon. The United States imposes economic sanctions on Myanmar and support Aung San Suu Kyi and her party. Following the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi in May 2003, the US imposed a new and harder ban.(37) The ban was renewed in July 2004.<br><br>

The European Union (EU) has adopted a similar position, also following policies strongly supportive of the democracy movement in Myanmar. The characteristics of EU policy could be summarized in three points: 1) a common line is always quite difficult to implement, leading to a weaker position by EU delegates; 2) EU pressure on the Myanmar military regime is generally indirect; and 3) the EU has directed its efforts increasingly towards ASEAN, trying to push Myanmar’s neighbours to use their greater influence for positive change.(38) In 2003 and in 2004, however, even the EU took a stronger stance toward Myanmar, with an extension of the scope of existing sanctions in view of the military regime’s failure to make significant progress in normalising the situation in the country. In their annual meeting of March 2005, Southeast Asian and European foreign ministers renewed pressure on Myanmar’s military regime over democratic reform, formally requesting access to a UN envoy in the country and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as recognizing the resumption of the national convention as a positive step toward that.<br><br>

Myanmar’s relationship with the West is complex and contradictory. Since 1988, the West’s application of sanctions and attempts to isolate Myanmar to force a transfer of power to the democratically-elected government, has increased Yangon’s suspicions about Washington’s designs. It is worth noting that there is little the West can do directly to remove Myanmar’s junta, and sanctions are proving to be ineffective. Unlike North Korea, there was up to now no incentive for the United States and its allies to confront Myanmar directly and, unlike Iraq, Myanmar does not have anything the West strongly needs. Furthermore, any military intervention in China’s sphere of influence would be considered unacceptable by Beijing.<br><br>

In reality, the China factor is the key to solving the Myanmar problem. The West should think about China’s possible role in developing Myanmar. China’s cooperation with the West, together with ASEAN, is the best way to press the current military regime toward the goal of a peaceful transfer of power.<br><br>

2. India<br><br>

India Myanmar’s the new strategic partner in recent years, the one who can alter the balance of power in the region. Myanmar and India share a border of about 1,331 km. Furthermore, Myanmar has a long coastline of 2,276 km that shares parts of the Bay of Bengal, in particular the surrounding areas of the Coco Islands and the Andaman Sea, which are very important in India’s strategic considerations. Myanmar’s location is central to strengthening India’s geopolitical position in Southeast Asia. At the same time, Myanmar also is a key stepping stone in India’s new ‘Look East’ policy which seeks to develop and expand political, economic and security ties with ASEAN.<br><br>

India’s growing interest in Myanmar could be seen from the shift of its low-key policy in the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s; the emphasis on human rights and democracy changed to a strategic realist policy towards Myanmar. The main reason for India’s shift was the growing concern over Myanmar’s abandonment of its traditional policy of ‘strategic neutrality’ and adoption of a strategic tilt toward China. Since the beginning of the 1990s, India has been sensitive to the growing influence and presence of China in the Bay of Bengal, particularly so when China helped to upgrade Myanmar’s radar facilities in the Coco Islands and the construction of a naval base in the Sittwe.
<br><br>
India increased its high-level delegation visits to Yangon, with the primary aim of moving Myanmar away from close ties with China. Besides playing on security and strategic issues, India also used religion in fostering closer India-Myanmar relations. Buddhism and Hinduism are depicted by the Indian leadership as ‘branches of the same tree’.(39) Thus India’s main objective is to remove Myanmar from China’s orbit or sphere of influence.(40)<br><br>

However, China has more leverage than India in seeking influence in Myanmar. First, there are more Chinese than Indian immigrants in the northern towns of Myanmar, engaging in trade and business. Thirty percent of the population in Mandalay, for example, are new migrants form China.(41) China also produces more cheap goods to sell than India. Finally, India’s lagging economy, the backwardness of the areas bordering Myanmar and separatist insurgencies in the Northeast regions make it difficult for India to compete with China in seeking influence and a presence in Myanmar.

3. ASEAN
<br><br>
Myanmar’s relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations represent one of the keys of Myanmar’s foreign policy. China’s growing influence over Myanmar has resulted in anxiety for the ASEAN states. The wariness over China’s inroads into Myanmar resulted in Thailand’s initiative - with the support of other ASEAN members - to lobby for Myanmar to become a full-fledged member of ASEAN in 1997. From Myanmar’s perspective, joining ASEAN moderates relations with China. Moreover, joining ASEAN, carried economic benefits as well as the prospect of having sanctions from the West lifted. However, Since the 1990s, relations between China and ASEAN greatly improved; China and ASEAN have signed a framework agreement on mutual co-operation. As a result, China has enhanced mutual understanding and trust with ASEAN in the political and security fields. The close ties between China and ASEAN could indicate that China would prefer a dialogue regarding Myanmar within the framework of ASEAN. There is no doubt that China has a stake in ASEAN. If the Myanmar issue damages intra-ASEAN relations, it could also damage Sino-ASEAN relations.

Problems and Difficulties<br><br>

1. Drugs <br><br>

Narcotics are a key issue in the Sino-Myanmar relationship. In reality, China is also a victim of drugs, in particular in the border areas with Myanmar. On 14 February 2006, Premier Wen Jiaobao of the State Council held talks with the Prime Minister of Myanmar, Soe Win. Premier Wen pointed out that the spread of narcotics in the border areas has severely damaged local communities, causing deaths and impairing people’s heath. It was necessary to take serious measures to stop it. China hopes to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Myanmar in narcotics control and sign the agreement on narcotics control cooperation at an early date.(42) Myanmar is the world’s second largest producer of illicit opium, Afghanistan being the first. Myanmar’s opium is grown predominantly in Shan State, in areas controlled by former insurgent groups. The main and the militarily strongest producers are the Wa. The value of opium production in 2005 was estimated at US $58 million, equivalent to about 0.7 per cent of the Myanmar’s GDP.(43)<br><br>

Historically, large-scale production of opium and heroin in Myanmar is related to Chinese interventions: first, from January 1950 KMT forces established bases inside Myanmar, following their defeat by the Chinese communists. Subsequently the CIA attempted to use these forces to resist the advance of Chinese communism. The KMT and CIA developed opium and heroin production as a means of funding the military operation.(44) Second, the military and other support given by China to the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), especially during and immediately after the Cultural Revolution, allowed the CPB to build up its forces and control larger tracts of territories. With the reduction of Chinese assistance which followed the accession of Deng Xiaoping in 1978, the opiate business was one of the few ways the CPB could acquire the funds to continue to hold onto substantial territory and maintain the armed struggle against Yangon.(45) In 1989 a mutiny took place within the CPB, and the army broke up into its ethnic components which, through the mediation of Lo Hsing Han, a Kokang Chinese warlord, agreed to cease-fire terms with the SLORC. The terms amounted to freedom for groups to produce and traffic opiates in exchange for a cease-fire with Yangon. <br><br>

China is currently the major transit country for Myanmar’s heroin, which is trucked to Kunming, and onwards deeper into China and via Hong Kong and ports on the South China coast, to Taiwan, the United States and other overseas markets. An increasing amount is being consumed in China.<br><br>

Since the mid-1990s Yunnan has become more organized in its crime prevention activities, with much technological assistance from the United States, but the crime wave, led by drug trafficking, has spread throughout the whole of China. In terms of drug problems, Sino-Myanmar relations have not progressed as well as they should.
<br><br>
2. HIV/AIDS(46)
<br><br>
Myanmar is one of the countries in Southeast Asia with the lowest life expectancy at birth, and now has one of the world’s fastest growing incidences of HIV/AIDS infection. UNAIDS estimates that the prevalence of HIV amongst adults aged 15 to 49 is 1.3% in 2006.(47) UNAIDS also estimates that approximately 650,000 people in China are infected with HIV, and injecting drug users account for almost half. In areas like Yunnan province, HIV prevalence among injecting drug users is over 50%. Export to China of HIV/AIDS from Myanmar, along with heroin addiction, could, in addition to the humanitarian implications, severely retard China’s economic development.<br><br>

The main reason of the spread of the HIV virus in Myanmar and China are needles shared by intravenous drug users and unprotected sex. The increasing migration and road transport from and across border acts to carry the virus, particularly along drug trafficking and labour migration routes, into Central Asia, South China and Hong Kong, as well as back into Myanmar. The border town of Ruili (China) and Muse (Myanmar) joined by a bridge on the Myanmar Road, are major centres of heroin trafficking and use, as well as of prostitution. Ruili and adjacent areas have been designated as a Special Development Zone in order to benefit from the border trade, and road, rail and water transport into Myanmar and China is being upgraded. This allows greater movement of vehicles transporting heroin and thus the flow-on spread of the HIV virus.<br><br>

Myanmar’s military government has not done enough to prevent the spread of the disease or educate the local people about its existence. In recent years, some international NGOs, together with Chinese local hospitals, have launched projects to control the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, in terms of China-Myanmar relations, considerable difficulties still remain in their struggle with HIV/AIDS.<br><br>

 

Prospects for Future Sino-Myanmar Relations<br><br>

What are the prospects for future Sino-Myanmar relations? The answer is uncertain. Both internal instability and external pressure in Myanmar are contributing factors that influence Sino-Myanmar relations in the short-term. However, the relationship is likely to be stable and friendly in the long-term, largely because China is willing to play an important role in developing relations to a higher and more sustainable level. <br><br>

1. China’s possible role<br><br>

Myanmar’s national reconciliation is a necessary step towards democratization. It has been at the heart of the democracy movement since 1988. There are two components of the national reconciliation: 1) reconciliation between the military junta and the democratic forces led by Aung San Suu Kyi; and 2) reconciliation between Burmans and other ethnic groups.<br><br>

The ethnic reconciliation began in December 1990, when the Karen National Union agreed to the formation of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB) in Karen territory. Despite agreements being concluded and the United Nations calling for dialogue to resolve Myanmar’s future,(48) a stalemate has ensued between the pro-democratic forces and the military government. China views Myanmar’s national reconciliation as a domestic issue. To adhere to the principle of non-intervention in state-to-state relations, China will not express any view about how the Myanmar regime should launch a dialogue with the opposition forces. China should not and will not have the right to interfere. This is China’s basic position.<br><br>

China has shared the same view as Myanmar with regard to bilateral relations, international situations, human rights and Western values. They were both invaded and exploited by Western imperialists and are suspicious of Western ideology. Both countries strongly oppose any interference in the domestic affairs of other countries on the pretext of religion or human rights. They have supported each other in the meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights. Thus, China will not be happy to see any country interfere in Myanmar’s domestic affairs. However, China acknowledges the positive result of dialogue on human rights issues. China itself has such regular dialogue with the United States and the European Union. For this reason, China will not oppose Yangon’s dialogue with any other countries regarding the human rights issues in Myanmar. Likewise, China will hold the same attitude towards the dialogue between the military regime and the opposition forces in Myanmar.<br><br>

China’s view regarding Aung San Suu Kyi is likely to be quite similar to the position it holds on the military junta ruling Myanmar. China usually regards Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi as a political instrument of the West. Moreover, from China’s perspective, she does not command sufficient capability to accomplish her aims and would be unlikely to become the next leader of Myanmar. In her struggle, she faces not just a few military leaders, but a strong, well-organized, unified and experienced Myanmar army, which cannot be easily overthrown. For this reason, China is very reluctant to push the dialogue of reconciliation between the Yangon government and Aung San Suu Kyi.(49) However, it should be noted that for the sake of regional stability as well as for the interests of China in Myanmar, China would rather not see domestic turmoil within country. A friendly and stable Myanmar is very important for China. For that reason, China was the first to offer its congratulations to the National League for Democracy immediately after the 1990 general elections.<br><br>

If Myanmar’s military regime is willing to arrive at a compromise with the opposition forces, China would welcome such an occurrence, and would possibly provide assistance upon the request of the Myanmar government. The success of economic reform in China has encouraged the Yangon regime to begin its own reform in recent years, and the China model may be regarded as the most suitable to follow in that economic reform occurs while maintaining authoritarian political control.<br><br>

Furthermore, since China is a regional great power, its influence over the surrounding countries is to be expected. This matters in terms of policy choices in Yangon. Because of the good relationship between China and Myanmar, if China expresses its willingness to see national reconciliation in Myanmar, Yangon would be more likely to listen to Beijing rather than being pressured to act by Western hardliners.<br><br>

There are other issues for China to consider. First, with regard to democratization, China faces the same problem. Whether Myanmar becomes democratic or not is purely a domestic matter of that country. According to China’s pragmatic foreign policy, China will have to respect the choice of the Myanmar people. Second, if there is a mechanism to be established within ASEAN in dealing with the issue of Myanmar, China will no doubt be willing to participate in the relevant process, as illustrated in the current ASEAN+3 and ASEAN +1 dialogues. China’s attitude could be more supportive. In addition, China and ASEAN have signed the framework agreement on mutual co-operation. As a result, China has enhanced mutual understanding and trust with ASEAN in the political and security fields. The close tie between China and ASEAN may well indicate that China would prefer a dialogue regarding Myanmar within the framework of ASEAN. Through early 2006 Beijing was willing to be more direct in urging Myanmar to further its economic reform and 'to continue to push forward reconciliation at home', while still recognising that human rights remained Rangoon's 'internal affair'.(50)<br><br>

2. The Prospects for Sino-Myanmar’s relations<br><br>

In June 2000, the Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxaun and Myanmar’s Foreign Minister U Win Aung signed a joint statement on ‘Future Cooperation in Bilateral Relations between the People's Republic of China and Federation of Myanmar.(51) This document determines the future direction of Sino-Myanmar relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the consolidation of mutual relations for wider regional stability and development.<br><br>

The document indicates an optimism about future relations. However, its realisation requires serious effort. As discussed above, China has vital interests in this region. By employing a pragmatic foreign policy and using economic cooperation, China believes relations will improve further. China has criticized the ‘hegemonic behaviour’ of the US when it declared its sanctions against Myanmar (the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003).(52) On the other hand, China was concerned as to whether Myanmar would yield to American pressure. China continues to promote the friendly relationship between ASEAN and Myanmar, and to support the Myanmar military government. Beijing’s own increasing economic cooperation with Yangon will increase its stake in the country. There is no doubt China will continue to maintain the traditional friendly relationship with Myanmar in the long-term. <br><br>

From the Myanmar side, military regime faces pressures from both inside and outside the country. Washington’s hardline approach has not been effective in pushing the Myanmar government to change its policy. Despite this, it is still a pressure tormenting the regime. Pressures may also come from other ASEAN member countries, such as Thailand and Philippines.<br><br>

The close political, military and economic ties with China are beneficial to the current regime, particularly in the context of sanctions and isolation from the West. Clearly, if the United Stats and other countries continue to choose to impose sanctions against Myanmar, this country will continue to rely heavily on China. Moreover, it should be noted that no matter who comes to power, even Aung San Suu Kyi, the Sino-Myanmar relationship will be maintained and developed in a friendly and stable manner.<br><br>

 

Conclusion<br><br>

China values its relationship with Myanmar, especially in its western development strategy, its active involvement in GMS (Greater Mekong Subregion) program and as a means to enhance its military presence in Southeast Asia. At the same time, it is also on the receiving end of many negative externalities from Myanmar, particularly the outflow of drugs and HIV/AIDS into Yunnan province. However, from the perspective of Myanmar, positive and reciprocal relation with China not only benefit the current regime, but also represent the only way to escape the hardship imposed by the sanctions of Western countries. Even if the current regime delivers power to the elected democratic government, the latter would still maintain strong relations with China for the sake of Myanmar’s strategic interests and economic development. Therefore this paper forecasts that irrespective of who is in power in Myanmar, the maintenance of positive relations with China is inevitable.<br><br>
